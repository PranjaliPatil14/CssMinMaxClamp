        <h3>Charmander</h3>
        <img src="./assets/images/charmander.jpg" />
        <p>
          Charmander is a bipedal, reptilian Pokémon with a primarily orange
          body and blue eyes. Its underside from the chest down and the soles of
          its feet are cream-colored. It has two small fangs visible in its
          upper jaw and two smaller fangs in its lower jaw. A fire burns at the
          tip of this Pokémon's slender tail and has blazed there since
          Charmander's birth. The flame can be used as an indication of
          Charmander's health and mood, burning brightly when the Pokémon is
          strong, weakly when it is exhausted, wavering when it is happy, and
          blazing when it is enraged. It is said that Charmander dies if its
          flame goes out. However, if the Pokémon is healthy, the flame will
          continue to burn even if it gets a bit wet and is said to steam in the
          rain. Charmander can be found in hot, mountainous areas. However, it
          is found far more often in the ownership of Trainers. As shown in
          Pokémon Snap, Charmander exhibits pack behavior, calling others of its
          species if it finds food.

        <h3>Bulbasaur</h3>
        <img src="./assets/images/bulbasaur.jpg" />
        <p>
          Bulbasaur is a small, quadruped Pokémon that has blue-green skin with
          darker patches. It has red eyes with white pupils, pointed, ear-like
          structures on top of its head, and a short, blunt snout with a wide
          mouth. A pair of small, pointed teeth are visible in the upper jaw
          when its mouth is open. Each of its thick legs ends with three sharp
          claws. On its back is a green plant bulb, which is grown from a seed
          planted there at birth. The bulb provides it with energy through
          photosynthesis as well as from the nutrient-rich seeds contained
          within. As mentioned in the anime, starter Pokémon are raised by
          Breeders to be distributed to new Trainers. Having been domesticated
          from birth, Bulbasaur is regarded as both a rare and well-behaved
          Pokémon. It is known to be extremely loyal, even after long-term
          abandonment. Bulbasaur has also shown itself to be an excellent
          caretaker, even having a special technique called the 'Bulba-by.' To
          perform this technique, Bulbasaur uses its vines to pick up a young
          Pokémon and soothingly rocks it in the air. It is found in grasslands
          and forests throughout the Kanto region. However, due to Bulbasaur's
          status as starter Pokémon, it is hard to come by in the wild and
          generally found under the ownership of a Trainer. It has been observed
          that a Bulbasaur's bulb will flash blue when it is ready to evolve. If
          it does not want to evolve, it struggles to resist the transformation.
          Many Bulbasaur gather every year in a hidden garden in Kanto to evolve
          into Ivysaur in a ceremony led by a Venusaur.

        <h3>Caterpie</h3>
        <img src="./assets/images/caterpie.jpg" />
        <p>
          Caterpie is a Pokémon that resembles a green caterpillar with a yellow
          underside and teardrop-shaped tail. There are yellow ring-shaped
          markings down the sides of its segmented body, which resemble its eyes
          and are meant to scare off predators. Its most notable characteristic
          is the bright red antenna (osmeterium) on its head, which releases a
          stench to repel predators. Despite these features and its camouflage
          in green foliage, Caterpie is often preyed upon by Flying-type
          Pokémon. Its four tiny feet are tipped with suction cups, permitting
          this Pokémon to scale most surfaces with minimal effort. Caterpie is
          easy to capture and grows quickly, making it ideal for new Trainers.
          It will shed its skin many times before finally cocooning itself in
          thick silk. It can also spit this silk in order to entangle foes as
          seen in the anime. It has a voracious appetite, which drives it to eat
          a hundred leaves a day. It will even eat leaves bigger than itself.
          According to Pokémon Adventures, its favorite food is the Vermilion
          flower. Caterpie lives in forests.

        <h3>Weedle</h3>
        <img src="./assets/images/weedle.jpg" />
        <p>
          Weedle is a larval Pokémon with a segmented body ranging in color from
          yellow to reddish-brown. Each segment of its body is a sphere. It has
          a bulbous red nose on its face and two spherical feet on each body
          segment. The combination of red and yellow coloration creates a bright
          warning to predators that it is poisonous. Weedle has a conical,
          two-inch (five centimeter) venomous stinger on its head and a barbed
          one on its tail. Weedle can retaliate against attackers and those who
          step on it with its strong toxin. It can distinguish its favorite
          kinds of leaves using its acute sense of smell. As a young Bug
          Pokémon, its daily appetite for leaves matches its weight. Weedle can
          be found in forests and usually hides in grass, bushes, and under the
          leaves it eats.
